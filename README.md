# Customer_Segmentation_using_ML

• Utilized Python and ML to segment customers based on financial behavior and pre-processed the data using Pandas and NumPy/n
• Employed the use of K-Means algorithm to perform unsupervised clustering and optimized the number of clusters using th elbow method\n
• Analyzed K-Means clusters using centers and reversed the scaling process to understand their characteristic’s real-world implications\n
• Categorized customers into well-defined segments such as Transactors, Revolvers, and VIPs, based on their distinctive payment behaviors\n
• Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the clusters in 2-dimensional space\n
• Used Seaborn to create informative scatter plots to show the separation of clusters in PCA space demonstrating segmentation efficiency\n
